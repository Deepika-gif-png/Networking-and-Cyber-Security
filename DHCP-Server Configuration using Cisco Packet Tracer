1. Topology

Devices:
2x Cisco 2960 Switches (Switch0, Switch1)
1x PC (PC0)
Connections:

4. PC0 Configuration

IP Configuration:
Method: DHCP
5. Verification

Check PC0 IP Address:
Open a command prompt on PC0.
Type ipconfig and press Enter.
Verify that PC0 has received an IP address from the DHCP server.
Explanation

VLAN 10: Both switches are configured with a single VLAN (VLAN 10) on the relevant interfaces. This ensures that all devices on the network belong to the same broadcast domain.
DHCP on PC0: The PC is configured to obtain its IP address dynamically using DHCP.
DHCP Server (Implicit): In this simplified example, we assume that a DHCP server is already present on the network (e.g., a router or a dedicated DHCP server). The PC will automatically request an IP address from this server.
Note:

This is a basic example. In real-world scenarios, you would typically configure a dedicated DHCP server (e.g., a router or a server running DHCP software) to provide IP addresses to network devices.
You can adjust the VLAN ID and other parameters as needed for your specific network requirements.

This configuration is for educational purposes and may require adjustments for specific network environments.
Always follow safety precautions and best practices when configuring network devices.
